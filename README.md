# Kasper HTML Template
Hi I am *philopatire*. I coded this template with some design

I have to write their names for their copyright

1. The Design from [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template)
2. The Photos from [desktopography](https://desktopography.net/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). **I will delete unknown copyright photos**
3. The Icons from [Font Awesome 5 Free](https://fontawesome.com/).
4. I use [normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) CSS framework 
5. I use [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) Font.

*Finally, I hope to be happy with my template.*

*Any Copyright i forgot to say it here. Contact Me Please*

***Thanks for your time.***
